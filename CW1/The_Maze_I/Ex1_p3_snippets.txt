Exercise 1 part 3: Assessing performance

- Math.random()
    Returns:
    1. a pseudorandom double greater than or equal to 0.0 and 
    less than 1.0. 
    2. Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately) 
    uniform distribution from that range.


- Math.round()
Returns:
    The value of the argument rounded to the *nearest* int value.

|0 — 1 — 2 — 3|
|--|---|---|--|
In the first program we generated the pseudorandom number using 
random function which produced the number withint the range 
between 0-3. The numbers generated has approximatly the same 
probability. However, when we rounded the number into integer, 
the probability has changed shown from the above diagram. 
The numbers has larger chance of being rounded to 1 and 2, 
and less chance of being rounded to 0 and 3. 

0 — 1 — 2 — 3 — 4
|---|---|---|---|
Now if we choose not to use the round() function anymore, 
but increase the range of the random generated number to 4. 
Tthe value will be evenly distributed within the range, and 
the probability of each direction will be equal to 1/4. 
(The controller only avoid the direction it is going to 
crash into the wall)
